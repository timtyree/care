We need to do more explaining where this attractive force comes from.  - TOOD: Plot the fields (V,y) along the activation front in the time leading up to an annihilation event for either full model- (left panel) Snapshot -2 ms before annihilation- (right panel) Plot histogram of curvature- DONE GOAL: show the local geometry supports this apparent attractive forceDONE: send notes on MSR_Osc (t + dt) minus (t)
DONE: make a new Fig. 1A
DONE: get 3 panels showing spiral tips approaching and annihilating for FK
DONE: get 3 panels showing spiral tips approaching and annihilating for LR
DONE: collect ^that into a SM figure
DONE: comment out the columns WJ doesn't want in table 1
DONE: test whether the analytic formula for tau(N_0) increases exponentially as A is increased
HINT: for A in A_values: record tau(N_0) for some N_0


TODO: fix uncertainty of a in Table 1.
HINT: take maxabs diff for maxiter/10 instead of maxiter*10

TODO: do anything else in red in figure 1
TODO: recall my previous computational speedup estimate and put it back in the Letter
HINT: it might be still there but commented out
TODO: change figure legends from Lin. to LPM and Osc. to OPM
TODO: show/find the plot showing the total P decreases exponentially

Yes, this may be the case. I wonder if this 4/3 is a coincidence or points to something deeper. Can you run these large a simulations for some other values of
D, r and kappa? This constant is probably a function of these parameters (I would guess certainly of r and kappa), in which case we should not report 4/3 but
simply say that it approaches a constant value.
TODO: dev run on osg for ^this with a few more choices of r, kappa, and D

Hi Wouter,

Here's the rearranged figures (see links postscript).

Best,
Tim
