GOAL: identify annihilations with a high degree of confidence
TODO: ensure each trajectory has only one annihilation considered, and that only the nearest pid_other is considered
TODO: compare apparent a using (I) nearest neighbors only and (II) all-to-all
TODO(later, long time to develop): develop method to extract trajectory of individual tips when the chirality is present...
TODO(later, long time to develop): extract chirality of individual tips and use this to filter pairs of tips

GOAL: generate a a table of estimates for a with different parameter settings


GOAL: generate a bluf that contains estimates for a for various parameter settings
