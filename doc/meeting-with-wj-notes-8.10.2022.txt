ANSATZ: reaction rate is zero when reaction ranges is large
TODO: test again at close ranges and high rates.
TODO: prepare a table of particle properties.
TODO: draft new manuscript
- start with the oscillatory bit
	- exists an effective attractive force
	- these plots also show an oscillatory attraction
	- we observe osciallations

- it's hard to simulate the osc. model, so we have the linear particle model

- we have this way to estimate alinear from msr

- we can reproduce the pair-annihilation rates
	- --> we can reproduce mean termination times

- (if ^that works on 200x200): start thinking fenton-karma for larger ones (the luo-rudy model is very finnicky)... just do both tim.
