We need to do more explaining where this attractive force comes from.
- TODO: Plot the fields (V,y) along the activation front in the time leading up to an annihilation event for either full model
- (left panel) Snapshot 2 ms before annihilation
- (right panel) Plot histogram of curvature 2 ms before annihilation
- GOAL: show the local geometry supports this apparent attractive force

# Brainstorming MVP for explaining where attraction comes from:

DONE: checked my Slides for something that could work
DONE: verified i made a module for estimating curvature of activation fronts
- NOTE: it looks like i didn't save ^that curvature data, so i'll need to recompute it
