DONE: use CardiacBD2021.pdf in the letter after the interoduction.  PM is efficient, and it will go unused if i don't.
DONE: see if setting the best FK period to the observed value, T, makes the MSR line up better.
DONE: analyze results from run #34
DONE: replace RMSE with mean percent error (MPE / M%E) in all fits in Table 1

DONE: estimate $a$ with oscillatory particle model
DONE: estimate $a$ with b.o.e. from R_rms^2/Gamma/32
DONE: estimate kappa from tau_infinity and P_qs?
DONE: grid search over r and/or r,kappa, sure to include the predictive kappa
