GOAL(by 2pm): have reasonable MSD and dRdt slides made for both full models
TODO: sanity check of dRdt magnitudes by plotting the speed for 1 trajectory versus time.  compute vrms.  you may simply refer to old vrms measurements
TODO: automate making MSD slide
TODO: compare MSD slides for various unwrapped trajectory folders... Do any old ones track long enough to show diffusion at long time scales?
TODO: dev filtering method for dRdt data before bootstrapping
TODO: automate making dRdt slide
