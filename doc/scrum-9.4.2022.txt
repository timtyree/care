GOAL: isosurfaces computed and visualized. some graph for WJ to look at tomorrow.
TODO: make mvp for WJ
- TODO: make 2D scatter plot, with diverging color map from desired
  - M,nu
  - conditioned on alinear FK,LR
- make ibid for different kwargs using different methods
  - CloughTocher2DInterpolator

TODO: attempt to verify the existence of the problem
- TODO: simply visualize what I currently have for interp
  - TODO: make 3D scatter plot, with diverging color map from desired M
  - TODO: make 3D scatter plot, with diverging color map from desired nu
  - TODO: make 2D scatter plot, with diverging color map from desired
    - M,nu
    - conditioned on alinear FK,LR
  - make ibid for different kwargs using different methods
    - CloughTocher2DInterpolator

***

Options for interpolator:
griddata just calls other scipy functions.
- DONT use griddata, because it doesn't return the function that I use in isoplanes


Q:  have more control if I use CloughTocher2DInterpolator versus griddata?
A: no. use griddata and then make switching between methods as simple as changing a kwarg!



CloughTocher2DInterpolator
Piecewise cubic, C1 smooth, curvature-minimizing interpolant in 2D.
interpolate many planes in data
and graph those planes in matplotlib in

Q: what method does LinearNDInterpolator use?
A: linear barycentric interpolation (of triangles?) from the Delaunay triangulation of the inputs

Q: what method does scipy.interpolate.NearestNDInterpolator use?
A: nearest neighbor interpolation using scipy.spatial.cKDTree
- note: likely requires me to rescale to a space where everything is of comparable magnitude
  - option 1: make it 1/kappa.
  - option 2: make it all rescaled to the unit cube.
  - option 3: both.


PROBLEM: i suspect wiggles due to 4D linear interp instead of 3D
- Option 0: attempt to make a simpler linear interpolator.
  - simpler linear interpolator: that performs barycentric interpolation of any nearby points
- TODO: Option 1: Condition on a particular value for D
  - TODO: Option 1: Select only points with D fixed.
  - DONT: Option 2: Attempt to interpolated to D fixed.
- DONT: Option 2: Attempt complicated GPR procedure, introducing many new parameters
  - i don't think i have a dense enough sample for the precision i need...
