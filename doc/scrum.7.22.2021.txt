# GOAL: have msd and average drdt versus r measured for each trial_name_folder in a list
- TODO: modify drdt function to only consider no more than a certain time since annihilation
- DONE: verify that these functions work on the particle model
- TODO: make an initial function that prints lifetime stats to help me decide parameter values
- TODO: dev lib.viewer.gener_bluf.py (Hint: see stackoverflow)
- TODO(lib.viewer.gener_bluf.py): make a function that does each elementary step of the analysis to generate for each folder a 1 page bluff.pdf with a rasterized/nonrasterized Images



# NEXT GOAL: compute D, m, b for each folder in trial_name_folder_lst
# NEXT GOAL: look for xy scaling that can best map the particle model onto the full model
