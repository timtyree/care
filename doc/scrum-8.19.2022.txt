*** Resolution of Singularities - Application of Singular Learning Tyeory to Cardiac Electrophysiology ***
GOAL: get the scale-invariant singular learning theory visualized by developing a custom sampling routine
TODO: merge the current data
TODO: compute interp from data as a map from parameters (r/L,kappa,alinear/L/L) to (M,nu)
TODO: compute level set surface for a desired M
TODO: compute level set surface for a desired nu
TODO: compute the intersection curve of " with ""
TODO: sample points on this curve. 
TODO(bonus): sample only points on this curve that are at least xs distance from the nearest sample point
--> nice 1D representation, s
TODO(bonus): randomly sample points in the neighborhood xd neighborhood of s
--> allows for (powerlaw?) estimation of loss as you move away from s.  note the direction away from s might matter.  this directional dependence can be tested for by measuring the loss profile projected in the direction normal to the M-isosurface relative the loss profile projected in the direction normal to the nu-isosurface.  if there is no directional dependence, then there will be no difference in the M-normal and nu-normal directionals
