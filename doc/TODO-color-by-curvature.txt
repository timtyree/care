TODO: make video coloring curvature 
- mean curvature of activation front colors the spiral tips
- local curvature colors the activation /deactivation front (for all 4 contours)
	- hot/cold with alpha=1. for high/low curvature of the V==V_threshold level set
	- hot/cold with alpha=0.3 for high/low curvature of the dVdt==0 level set

TODO: directly use comp_curvature_array with the smallest sample neighborhood that yields results equivalent to the full results... Define ^this in terms of a local_curvature_kernel... 
TODO(later): cythonize ^this local_curvature_kernel?
