#TODO: decide whether a 0D or 1D locus defines the ground truth
#HINT: draw level-sets for M=M* and nu=nu*.  How slight is their intersection?

TODO: attempt to compute the distribution of RMSE versus distance from the minimal locus, where (M,nu)=(M*,nu*).  Does it have an exponent or an RLCT?
TODO: consider making /bgmc/dst/ containing 1 .csv file of powerlaw fits for a given data run
