current task = get curves to cross


todo for getting a spiral wave started
done1 - advance in time until some tissue repolarizes in the center
done2 - make a box near a roughly horizontal direction
done3 - detect spiral tips before/after placing ^that box. done. no spiral tips exist.
done4 - advance in time detecting each time step
done5 - save tip log initially and reproducibly
done - get mean voltage back to a numeric value
done - get tip positions routed through as a nested list
done - save, set running, then check on the data every now and again... consider making plots...  enjoy your time with your friends.
TODO: after completing a run of tips for a square perturbation, complete a run of tips for a circular perturbation.
TODO: make a decision tree to control data recording and early exiting for a remote simulation
TODO: make tips export with local features (this might help with tip discrimination)

todo(later)
TODO: TODO: color map plot_tips by n_list
x - make a stream of separate txt files to a log folder
x - make a python function that, when called, takes the sum of the contents in ^that folder
8 - put starting the initial N steps and the initial spacing into a function that runs the simulation and tracks some spiral tips
9 - run the nvme_tests = the check for nvme on this computer
10 - make an analysis notebook. turn it into a jupyter lab view.  take a screen shot
11 -  edit the .css file to make a simplified work view.  is is just the matter of arranging figures? if so, maximize that volume and take a screen shot
