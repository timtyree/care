TODO for AVICA
which is a spacetime generalization of variational integrators that allows you to take different timesteps for different elements, which is important as slivers in the mesh often force you to take very small timesteps because of the CFL condition, and a global tensor product spacetime mesh would mean that the entire domain has to be advanced using that small timestep.

After today, I'll test that and see if I can reproduce the tests on an AVI on 2D flat space tessellated by triangles.  Once that works, I'll embed an example patient's atrium in 3D space, and tesselated it with triangles, and run the xgboost code on it, where I could smoothly track spiral tips on the atrial surface using a ray tracing projection onto the bezier surface generated by the patient's vertices as control knots.
